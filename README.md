## Why senalVIM has no typical neovim package manager?

Well, you may be asking, Senal, why there is no typical neovim package manager
for this build? Well, senalvim is not a really a neovim distribution of neovim
but it is a wrapper for neovim. 


The end result???? Perfomance.....

The package manager for senalvim is based on shell scripts. Essentially cloned into 
the right directory of neovim (Like it should be).
